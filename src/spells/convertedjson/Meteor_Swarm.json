A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.\n\tThe spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.\n",
