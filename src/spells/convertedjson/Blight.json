The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\n\tIf you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.\n\tIf you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.\n\tAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level of higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.\n","Range":{"English":"30 feet","Distance":30},"Date":"2015-01-01","Source":{"Resource":"PHB","Location":"219"},"Name":"Blight","Classes":["druid","sorcerer","warlock","wizard"]}
