Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.\n\tFor the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.\n","Range":{"English":"30 feet","Distance":30},"Date":"2015-01-02","Source":{"Resource":"PHB","Location":"265"},"Name":"Phantom Steed","Classes":[]}
