    "Effect": "\tA 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spellâ\u20ac™s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphereâ\u20ac™s space is difficult terrain.\n\tUntil the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.\n\tCreatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.\n\tAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases for each of its effects by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.\n",
