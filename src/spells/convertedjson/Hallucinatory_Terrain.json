Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area arenâ\u20AC™t changed in appearance.\n\tThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isnâ\u20AC™t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.\n","Range":{"English":"300 feet","Distance":300},"Date":"2015-07-30","Source":{"Resource":"PHB","Location":"249"},"Name":"Hallucinatory Terrain","Classes":["bard","druid","warlock","wizard"]}
