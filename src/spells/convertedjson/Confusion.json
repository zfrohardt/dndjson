    "Effect": "\tThis spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or by affected by it.\n\tAn affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.\n\t1: The creature uses up all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn.\n\t2-6: The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.\n\t7-8: The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.\n\t9-10: The creature can act and move normally.\n\tAt the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target\n\tAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each spell slot above 4th.\n",
