If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.\n\tYou can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.\n\tThe flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.\n\tAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd.\n",
