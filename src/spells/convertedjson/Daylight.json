The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.\n\tIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isnâ\u20ac™t being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\n\tIf any of this spellâ\u20ac™s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.\n",
