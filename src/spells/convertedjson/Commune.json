You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.\n\tDivine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive \"unclear\" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.\n\tIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.\n","Range":{"English":"self","Distance":0},"Date":"2015-07-14","Source":{"Resource":"PHB","Location":"223"},"Name":"Commune","Classes":["cleric"]}
