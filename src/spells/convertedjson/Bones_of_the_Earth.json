Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius. The rubble lasts until cleared.\n\tIf a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.\n\tIf a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creatureâ\u20AC™s choice) against the spellâ\u20AC™s saving throw DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.\n\tAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.\n","Range":{"English":"120 feet","Distance":120},"Date":"2015-11-19","Source":{"Resource":"EE","Location":"15"},"Name":"Bones of the Earth","Classes":["druid"]}
