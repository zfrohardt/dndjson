A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the *[alarm](..\/alarm\/ \"alarm (lvl 1)\")* spell, a *[glyph of warding](..\/glyph-of-warding\/ \"glyph of warding (lvl 3)\")*, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.\n\tThis spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.\n","Range":{"English":"120 feet","Distance":120},"Date":"2015-07-14","Source":{"Resource":"PHB","Location":"241"},"Name":"Find Traps","Classes":["cleric","druid","ranger"]}
