If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked.\n\tIf you choose a target that is held shut with *[arcane lock](../arcane-lock/ \"arcane lock (lvl 2)\")*, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally.\n\tWhen you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.\n",
