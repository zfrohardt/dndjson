The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.\n\tIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone elseâ\u20AC™s voice, a lionâ\u20AC™s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. \n\tIf you create an image of an objectâ\u20AC\u201Dsuch as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chestâ\u20AC\u201Dit must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image canâ\u20AC™t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. \n\tIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.\n","Range":{"English":"30 feet","Distance":30},"Date":"2014-08-24","Source":{"Resource":"PHB","Location":"260"},"Name":"Minor Illusion","Classes":["bard","sorcerer","warlock","wizard"]}
