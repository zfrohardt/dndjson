Choose one of the following options for what appears:\n\t* One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower\n* Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower\n* Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower\n* Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower\n\tEach beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.\n\tThe summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you donâ\u20ac™t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.\n\tThe DM has the creaturesâ\u20ac™ statistics.\n\tAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level\n",
