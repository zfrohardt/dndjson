A creature with darkvision canâ\u20ac™t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light canâ\u20ac™t illuminate it. If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isnâ\u20ac™t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness. If any of this spellâ\u20ac™s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. \n",
