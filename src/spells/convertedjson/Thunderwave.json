On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnâ\u20ac™t pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spellâ\u20ac™s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.\n\tAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.\n",
