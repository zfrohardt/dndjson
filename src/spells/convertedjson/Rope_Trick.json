One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends. \n\tThe extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.\n\tAttacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.\n\tAnything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.\n","Range":{"English":"touch","Distance":5},"Date":"2015-07-30","Source":{"Resource":"PHB","Location":"272"},"Name":"Rope Trick","Classes":["wizard"]}
