It takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\tTo break out, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.\n\tAs an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.\n","Range":{"English":"30 feet","Distance":30},"Date":"2015-11-19","Source":{"Resource":"EE","Location":"20"},"Name":"Maximilian's Earthen Grasp","Classes":["sorcerer","wizard"]}
