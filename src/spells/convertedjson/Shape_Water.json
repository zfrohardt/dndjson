    "Effect": "\tYou choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:\n\t* You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesnâ\u20ac™t have enough force to cause damage.\n* You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.\n* You change the waterâ\u20ac™s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.\n* You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.\n\tIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.\n",
