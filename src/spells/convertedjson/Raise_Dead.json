If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.\n\tThis spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell canâ\u20ac™t return an undead creature to life.\n\tThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survivalâ\u20ac\u201dits head, for instanceâ\u20ac\u201dthe spell automatically fails.\n\tComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ\u20194 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.\n",
