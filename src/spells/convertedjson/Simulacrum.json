The duplicate is a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.\n\tThe simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.\n\tIf the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.\n\tIf you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you created with this spell are instantly destroyed.\n","Range":{"English":"touch","Distance":5},"Date":"2015-01-12","Source":{"Resource":"PHB","Location":"276"},"Name":"Simulacrum","Classes":[" [wizard"]}
